# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently enhancing the job recommendation system's API capabilities with a focus on:

1. **Feedback Collection and Analysis**
   - Implemented recommendation feedback endpoints to collect user input on recommendation quality
   - Added analytics capabilities to aggregate and analyze feedback data
   - Created mechanisms to improve recommendations based on user feedback

2. **Advanced Skill Analysis**
   - Developed skill clustering endpoint to group related skills based on co-occurrence patterns
   - Enhanced skill gap analysis with more detailed insights
   - Improved skill matching algorithms for better recommendations

3. **API Stability and Performance**
   - Fixed import path issues that were causing server startup problems
   - Improved error handling and input validation
   - Enhanced backward compatibility for existing endpoints

## Recent Changes

### Recommendation Feedback System

We've implemented a comprehensive feedback system for recommendations that allows:
- Users to provide relevance and accuracy scores for recommendations
- Collection of qualitative feedback through text comments
- Tracking of user actions taken on recommendations (viewed, applied, saved, etc.)
- Aggregation of feedback data for analytics purposes

The feedback system includes two main endpoints:
- `POST /recommendations/feedback` - For submitting feedback
- `GET /recommendations/feedback/summary` - For retrieving aggregated feedback statistics

### Skill Clusters Analysis

We've added a new endpoint for analyzing skill relationships:
- `GET /ml/skills/clusters` - Returns groups of related skills with confidence scores
- Supports filtering by confidence threshold
- Provides detailed information about each cluster including:
  - Core skills and related skills
  - Industry relevance
  - Growth rates and market demand
  - Confidence scores for skill relationships

### Import Path Fixes

We've addressed issues with import paths in the backend application:
- Changed absolute imports (`from backend.utils...`) to relative imports (`from utils...`)
- Fixed module import errors that were preventing server startup
- Improved error handling for import-related issues

## Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Requirement**
   - All new endpoints require authentication with JWT tokens
   - This ensures data security and user-specific responses

2. **Simulated Data vs. Real Models**
   - Currently using simulated data for some endpoints due to development constraints
   - Planning to replace with actual machine learning models in future iterations

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Implemented comprehensive input validation
   - Added detailed error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Created fallback mechanisms for handling edge cases

4. **Documentation Approach**
   - Created detailed documentation for each new endpoint
   - Included examples, parameter descriptions, and use cases
   - Added test scripts to validate functionality

## Next Actions

1. Continue addressing import path issues for smoother development experience
2. Implement additional analytics endpoints for recommendation performance
3. Enhance test coverage for new endpoints
4. Improve error handling for edge cases
5. Begin work on frontend components to utilize the new API endpoints
