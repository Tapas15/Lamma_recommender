- Visual demonstration workflow implementation

### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test scripts created for search and recommendation system
- Test suite for verifying vector embeddings across all collections
- Specialized tests for recommendation system functionality
- Test documentation and troubleshooting guides

### API Enhancements
- Enhanced candidate recommendations API with advanced filtering capabilities
- Implemented experience-based filtering (min/max years)
- Added education level filtering (Bachelors, Masters, PhD)
- Integrated location-based filtering and remote work preferences
- Implemented availability filtering (immediate, 2 weeks, etc.)
- Added customizable sorting options (match score, experience)
- Improved response formatting with metadata and filter information
- Created comprehensive documentation for API improvements
- Developed test scripts to validate the enhanced API functionality

### Talent Search API
- Created new talent search API endpoint with advanced filtering capabilities
- Implemented vector-based semantic search for candidate matching
- Added detailed match scoring with skill and experience match factors
- Integrated multiple filtering options (experience, education, location, availability)
- Created comprehensive documentation for the talent search API
- Developed test script to validate the talent search functionality
- Added support for various sorting options

## Next Steps
1. Integrate the talent search API with the frontend
2. Extend similar filtering capabilities to other recommendation endpoints
3. Implement proper geocoding for location-based filtering
4. Add pagination support for large result sets
5. Add skills-based filtering with minimum proficiency levels
6. Run the test scripts to verify search and recommendation functionality
7. Fix any issues identified by the tests
8. Optimize the recommendation engine based on test results
9. Complete user authentication system
10. Enhance profile management interfaces
11. Optimize Ollama integration for embeddings
