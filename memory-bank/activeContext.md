# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is in active development with focus on core functionality implementation and testing. Recent efforts have focused on implementing and testing the search and recommendation system functionality.

## Recent Changes
### Initial Setup
- Project structure established
- Core dependencies defined
- Basic frontend and backend setup
- Database initialization scripts
- Testing framework integration
- Setup scripts for cross-platform compatibility
- Visual demonstration workflow implementation

### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test scripts created for search and recommendation system
- Test suite for verifying vector embeddings across all collections
- Specialized tests for recommendation system functionality
- Test documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Next Steps
1. Run the test scripts to verify search and recommendation functionality
2. Fix any issues identified by the tests
3. Optimize the recommendation engine based on test results
4. Complete user authentication system
5. Enhance profile management interfaces
6. Optimize Ollama integration for embeddings
7. Expand testing coverage to other areas
