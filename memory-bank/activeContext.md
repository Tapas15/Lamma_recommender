## Recent Changes

### Demo Data Generation Scripts

We've implemented comprehensive scripts for generating realistic demo data:
- `create_demo_candidates.py` - Creates candidate accounts with realistic profile data
- `create_demo_employers.py` - Creates employer accounts with realistic company data
- `create_demo_jobs_projects.py` - Creates job and project postings using employer accounts
- `DEMO_DATA_README.md` - Documentation explaining how to use these scripts

These scripts use the Faker library to generate realistic information and make API calls to create the entities in the database. Results are saved to JSON files for reference.

### Setup Script Improvements

We've fixed issues in the setup.py script:
- Modified the run_command function to handle Unicode properly by changing text=True to text=False and adding proper UTF-8 decoding
- Made the pip upgrade step optional if it fails due to permission errors
- Enhanced error handling for better user experience during setup

### API Testing

We've added a test_endpoint.py script to test API endpoints with authentication:
- Tests the health endpoint
- Tests the ML learning recommendations endpoint
- Tests the original learning recommendations endpoint for comparison

### Market Trends Prediction

We've implemented a new endpoint for predicting skill market trends:
- `GET /ml/market-trends` - Returns predictions for skill demand over different timeframes
- Supports multiple timeframe options (3 months to 5 years)
- Provides detailed information for each skill trend including:
  - Current and projected demand scores
  - Growth rates and confidence scores
  - Salary projections and industry relevance
  - Complementary skills and market factors

### Recommendation Feedback System

We've implemented a comprehensive feedback system for recommendations that allows:
- Users to provide relevance and accuracy scores for recommendations
- Collection of qualitative feedback through text comments
- Tracking of user actions taken on recommendations (viewed, applied, saved, etc.)
- Aggregation of feedback data for analytics purposes

The feedback system includes two main endpoints:
- `POST /recommendations/feedback` - For submitting feedback
- `GET /recommendations/feedback/summary` - For retrieving aggregated feedback statistics

### Skill Clusters Analysis

We've added a new endpoint for analyzing skill relationships:
- `GET /ml/skills/clusters` - Returns groups of related skills with confidence scores
- Supports filtering by confidence threshold
- Provides detailed information about each cluster including:
  - Core skills and related skills
  - Industry relevance
  - Growth rates and market demand
  - Confidence scores for skill relationships

### Import Path Fixes

We've addressed issues with import paths in the backend application:
- Changed absolute imports (`from backend.utils...`) to relative imports (`from utils...`)
- Fixed module import errors that were preventing server startup
- Improved error handling for import-related issues

## Decisions and Considerations

1. **Testing Approach**
   - Created realistic demo data generation scripts to facilitate testing
   - Used actual API calls to create test data in the database
   - Saved generated data to JSON files for reference and reuse

2. **Authentication Requirement**
   - All new endpoints require authentication with JWT tokens
   - This ensures data security and user-specific responses
   - Test scripts include proper authentication handling

3. **Simulated Data vs. Real Models**
   - Currently using simulated data for some endpoints due to development constraints
   - Planning to replace with actual machine learning models in future iterations

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Implemented comprehensive input validation
   - Added detailed error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Created fallback mechanisms for handling edge cases
   - Enhanced setup scripts with better error handling

5. **Documentation Approach**
   - Created detailed documentation for each new endpoint and test script
   - Included examples, parameter descriptions, and use cases
   - Added test scripts to validate functionality

## Next Actions

1. Continue enhancing test coverage with more comprehensive test scripts
2. Address any issues identified during testing
3. Implement additional analytics endpoints for recommendation performance
4. Improve error handling for edge cases
5. Begin work on frontend components to utilize the new API endpoints
6. Enhance demo data generation with more realistic scenarios
