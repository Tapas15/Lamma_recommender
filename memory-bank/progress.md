# Project Progress

## Current Status

The Job Recommendation System has made significant progress with several key API endpoints implemented and improved:

### Recently Completed

1. **Recommendation Feedback System**
   - Implemented `/recommendations/feedback` POST endpoint for users to submit feedback on recommendations
   - Added `/recommendations/feedback/summary` GET endpoint for aggregated feedback statistics
   - Created comprehensive documentation and test scripts
   - Fixed import path issues for proper server operation

2. **Skill Clusters Analysis**
   - Added `/ml/skills/clusters` GET endpoint for analyzing skill relationships
   - Implemented confidence-based filtering and detailed cluster analysis
   - Created comprehensive documentation with examples and use cases
   - Developed test script with various parameter combinations

3. **API Improvements**
   - Fixed import path issues in backend application
   - Enhanced error handling and input validation
   - Improved backward compatibility for endpoints

### Working Features

- User authentication and profile management
- Job posting and management
- Project creation and management
- Candidate recommendations for jobs
- Job recommendations for candidates
- Project recommendations
- Skill gap analysis
- Career path recommendations
- Talent search functionality
- Similar jobs recommendations
- Recommendation feedback collection
- Skill clusters analysis

### In Progress

- Fixing server startup issues related to import paths
- Enhancing test coverage for new endpoints
- Improving error handling for edge cases

### Next Steps

1. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Implement additional analytics endpoints for recommendation performance
   - Create visualization components for the frontend

2. **Machine Learning Enhancements**
   - Improve embedding generation for better recommendations
   - Implement more sophisticated matching algorithms

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Enhance feedback collection with more detailed options
   - Implement A/B testing for recommendation algorithms

## Known Issues

1. Import path issues when running the server from within the backend directory
   - Current workaround: Change absolute imports to relative imports
   - Future solution: Restructure the project for proper Python package imports

2. Authentication token handling for testing endpoints
   - Current workaround: Manual login in test scripts
   - Future solution: Implement proper test fixtures with authentication

## Technical Debt

1. Inconsistent import patterns throughout the codebase
2. Limited test coverage for some endpoints
3. Simulated data generation instead of real machine learning models for some endpoints

## Recent Milestones

- ✅ Implemented recommendation feedback system
- ✅ Created skill clusters analysis endpoint
- ✅ Fixed critical import path issues
- ✅ Improved documentation for new endpoints
