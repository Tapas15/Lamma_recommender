======================
Date: 2025-05-26
Project: Job Recommender Application

OVERVIEW
--------
This report documents the cleanup and reorganization of test files, temporary files, 
and unnecessary files in the project structure. All test-related and temporary files 
have been moved to the /test directory for better organization.

3. TEMPORARY FILES (moved to test/temporary_files/)
   - test_language.py (1.6KB, 49 lines)
     Purpose: Language testing script
     Reason: Temporary test file
   
   - simple_app.py (11KB, 276 lines)

- setup.bat, setup.sh - Platform-specific setup scripts
- start_services.bat - Service starter
- manage_app.bat, manage_app.sh - Application management scripts

UTILITY SCRIPTS:
- start_services.py (4.9KB, 141 lines) - Service management
- maintenance.py (3.6KB, 94 lines) - Maintenance utilities

- .cursorrules (3.4KB, 108 lines) - Cursor IDE rules

DIRECTORIES ANALYZED
--------------------

ROOT DIRECTORY:
✓ Cleaned - Test files moved to test/ directory
✓ Core application files remain in place

BACKEND DIRECTORY:
✓ Analyzed - Contains legitimate backend code
✓ Moved test_feedback_endpoint.py to test/temporary_files/
✓ backend/tests/ contains proper test suite (kept in place)

FRONTEND DIRECTORY:
✓ Analyzed - Contains Next.js application
✓ No unnecessary files found

PAGES DIRECTORY:
✓ Analyzed - Contains Streamlit pages
✓ All files are legitimate application pages

UTILS DIRECTORY:
✓ Analyzed - Contains utility modules
✓ All files are core utilities (database, models, etc.)

TESTS DIRECTORY:
✓ Analyzed - Contains comprehensive test suite
✓ All files are legitimate test files (kept in place)

MEMORY-BANK DIRECTORY:
✓ Analyzed - Contains project memory bank
✓ All files are project documentation (kept in place)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

1. FUTURE FILE ORGANIZATION:
   - Always create test files in the test/ directory
   - Use appropriate subdirectories for different types of tests
   - Keep temporary/experimental files in test/temporary_files/

2. SETUP SCRIPT UPDATES:
   - Update setup.py to reference moved files in test/ directory
   - Ensure verification scripts work from new locations

3. GITIGNORE UPDATES:
   - Add __pycache__/ to .gitignore if not already present
   - Consider adding test/temporary_files/ to .gitignore

4. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Update any references to moved files in documentation
   - Keep this cleanup report for future reference

SUMMARY
-------
Total files moved: 8 files
Total directories cleaned: Multiple __pycache__ directories
Space saved: Removed temporary cache files
Organization improved: Clear separation of test and core files

The project structure is now cleaner and more organized, with all test-related 
files properly categorized in the test/ directory. Core application functionality 
remains unchanged and accessible from the root directory.

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Update any scripts that reference the moved files
2. Test that the application still runs correctly
3. Update documentation to reflect new file locations
4. Consider adding this cleanup process to regular maintenance procedures
