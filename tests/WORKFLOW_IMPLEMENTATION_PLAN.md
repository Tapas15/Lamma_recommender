# Implementation Plan for Complete Workflow Test

This document provides a detailed plan for completing the implementation of the comprehensive workflow test. The current `complete_workflow_test.py` provides the framework, but needs specific implementations for each workflow function.

## Required Functions to Implement

### Utility Functions

1. **`start_services()`**
   - Check if backend and frontend are running
   - Start them if needed
   - Wait for services to be fully operational

2. **`register_employer(driver)`**
   - Navigate to registration form
   - Fill in employer details
   - Handle form submission
   - Verify successful registration
   - Return credentials

3. **`login_employer(driver, email, password)`**
   - Navigate to login form
   - Enter credentials
   - Submit form
   - Verify successful login

4. **`register_candidate(driver)`**
   - Navigate to registration form
   - Fill in candidate details
   - Handle form submission
   - Verify successful registration
   - Return credentials

5. **`login_candidate(driver, email, password)`**
   - Navigate to login form
   - Enter credentials
   - Submit form
   - Verify successful login

6. **`logout(driver)`**
   - Find and click logout button
   - Verify successful logout

### Employer Workflow Functions

1. **`post_job(driver)`**
   - Navigate to job posting form
   - Fill in all job details (title, description, requirements, etc.)
   - Submit form
   - Verify job was created successfully
   - Capture and return job ID

2. **`post_project(driver)`**
   - Navigate to project posting form
   - Fill in all project details
   - Submit form
   - Verify project was created successfully
   - Capture and return project ID

3. **`view_candidate_recommendations(driver, job_id)`**
   - Navigate to recommendations section
   - Select the job to view recommendations for
   - Verify recommendations are displayed
   - Capture screenshot

4. **`update_employer_profile(driver)`**
   - Navigate to profile section
   - Update several profile fields
   - Save changes
   - Verify changes were saved

### Candidate Workflow Functions

1. **`browse_jobs(driver)`**
   - Navigate to jobs section
   - Apply filters if needed
   - Verify jobs are displayed
   - Capture screenshot

2. **`apply_for_job(driver, job_id)`**
   - Navigate to job details
   - Click apply button
   - Fill in application details (resume, cover letter)
   - Submit application
   - Verify application was submitted

3. **`view_job_recommendations(driver)`**
   - Navigate to recommendations section
   - Verify recommendations are displayed
   - Capture screenshot

4. **`browse_projects(driver)`**
   - Navigate to projects section
   - Apply filters if needed
   - Verify projects are displayed
   - Capture screenshot

5. **`view_project_recommendations(driver)`**
   - Navigate to project recommendations
   - Verify recommendations are displayed
   - Capture screenshot

6. **`update_candidate_profile(driver)`**
   - Navigate to profile section
   - Update several profile fields
   - Save changes
   - Verify changes were saved

## Implementation Strategy

To complete the workflow test implementation:

1. **Extract Existing Code**
   - Reuse relevant code from the `visual_demo.py` script
   - Adapt the functions to fit the workflow test structure

2. **Implement Function by Function**
   - Start with the registration and login functions
   - Then implement job/project posting functions
   - Add recommendation viewing functions last

3. **Add Error Handling**
   - Add robust error handling to each function
   - Capture screenshots on failures
   - Provide detailed error messages

4. **Add Verification Steps**
   - Add verification after each significant action
   - Use WebDriverWait to ensure elements are loaded
   - Verify expected page/component state after actions

## Final Integration

Once all functions are implemented:

1. Update the `employer_complete_workflow()` function to call all the employer-specific functions
2. Update the `candidate_complete_workflow()` function to call all the candidate-specific functions
3. Test the complete workflow to ensure each step works correctly
4. Add options to exit early on failure or continue despite errors

## Usage Examples

Examples of how to use the completed workflow test:

```python
# Register new employer and perform complete workflow
employer_complete_workflow(driver)

# Use existing employer account
test_data["employer"]["email"] = "existing_employer@example.com"
test_data["employer"]["password"] = "password123"
employer_complete_workflow(driver)

# Register new candidate and perform complete workflow
candidate_complete_workflow(driver)

# Use existing candidate account
test_data["candidate"]["email"] = "existing_candidate@example.com"
test_data["candidate"]["password"] = "password123"
candidate_complete_workflow(driver)
```
