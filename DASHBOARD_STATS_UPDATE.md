# Dashboard Statistics - Real Data Implementation

## Overview
Updated the candidate dashboard to fetch real data from the backend APIs instead of using hardcoded values for the career development overview statistics.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Services Enhancement (`frontend/lnd-nexus/app/services/api.ts`)

Added two new API service modules:

#### Applications API
```typescript
export const applicationsApi = {
  // Get all applications for the current candidate
  getApplications: async (token: string): Promise<any[]>
  
  // Apply for a job  
  createApplication: async (token: string, applicationData: any): Promise<any>
}
```

#### Saved Jobs API
```typescript
export const savedJobsApi = {
  // Get all saved jobs for the current candidate
  getSavedJobs: async (token: string): Promise<any[]>
  
  // Save a job
  saveJob: async (token: string, jobData: any): Promise<any>
  
  // Remove a saved job
  removeSavedJob: async (token: string, savedJobId: string): Promise<any>
}
```

### 2. Dashboard Data Fetching (`frontend/lnd-nexus/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### Updated Imports
- Added `applicationsApi` and `savedJobsApi` to the import statement

#### Enhanced `fetchDashboardData` Function
The function now fetches real data for all dashboard statistics:

1. **Job Applications Count**
   - Calls `applicationsApi.getApplications(token)` 
   - Sets `stats.job_applications` to the length of returned applications array

2. **Saved Jobs Count**
   - Calls `savedJobsApi.getSavedJobs(token)`
   - Sets `stats.saved_jobs` to the length of returned saved jobs array

3. **Recommendation Matches Count**
   - Calls `enhancedRecommendationsApi.getJobRecommendations(token, { min_match_score: 70 })`
   - Sets `stats.recommendation_matches` to the count of high-scoring recommendations

4. **Profile Analytics Integration**
   - Calls `candidateAnalyticsApi.getProfileAnalytics(token)`
   - Merges analytics data including:
     - `profile_completion` percentage
     - `profile_views` count
     - Overrides other stats if provided by analytics API

## Backend API Endpoints Used

### Applications
- `GET /applications` - Returns candidate's job applications
- `POST /applications` - Create new application

### Saved Jobs  
- `GET /saved-jobs` - Returns candidate's saved jobs
- `POST /saved-jobs` - Save a job
- `DELETE /saved-jobs/{id}` - Remove saved job

### Analytics
- `GET /analytics/profile` - Returns profile analytics including completion and views
- `GET /analytics/applications` - Returns application analytics  

### Recommendations
- `GET /recommendations/jobs?min_match_score=70` - Returns high-quality job matches

## Statistics Displayed

The dashboard now shows real data for:

1. **Profile Completion** (%)
   - From analytics API or calculated based on profile completeness
   - Shows progress bar

2. **Applications** (count)
   - Total number of job applications submitted by candidate
   - Fetched from applications API

3. **Profile Views** (count)  
   - Number of times candidate's profile has been viewed
   - From analytics API

4. **Saved Jobs** (count)
   - Number of jobs saved by candidate for later review
   - Fetched from saved jobs API

5. **Matches** (count)
   - Number of job recommendations with 70%+ match score
   - Calculated from recommendations API

## Error Handling

Each API call includes proper error handling:
- Falls back to previous values if API calls fail
- Logs errors to console for debugging
- Maintains user experience even if some endpoints are unavailable

## User Experience Improvements

- **Real-time Data**: Stats reflect actual user activity and platform engagement
- **Personalized Metrics**: Each user sees their own application and activity data
- **Accurate Progress**: Profile completion shows genuine completeness percentage
- **Meaningful Counts**: All numbers represent real interactions and saved content

## Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. **Login as candidate**: Use test credentials from backend
2. **Check console logs**: APIs log successful data fetching  
3. **Verify stats accuracy**: 
   - Apply to jobs → Applications count increases
   - Save jobs → Saved jobs count increases
   - Complete profile → Profile completion percentage updates
4. **Test error resilience**: Disconnect backend → Dashboard still loads with fallback data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket connections for live stat updates
- **Historical trends**: Show stat changes over time periods
- **Benchmarking**: Compare user stats to platform averages
- **Goal setting**: Allow users to set targets for applications, etc.
- **Analytics dashboard**: Detailed breakdown of profile views, application success rates

## Technical Notes

- Maintains backward compatibility with existing dashboard structure
- Uses TypeScript for type safety on API responses  
- Implements proper async/await error handling
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Console logging for development debugging and monitoring
